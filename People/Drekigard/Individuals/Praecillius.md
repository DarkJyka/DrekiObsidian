- Gave a fake name in the city of [[Queensgrace]], when asked his name. The fake name he gave was *Kravas Hransgard*. 
- This is the name of someone he once had killed.
- He's used to run an illegal fighting ring, back in the Elven Kingdom, before it became the [[Darklands]]. *(This was around 80 years ago, per the 4th year of Post-Centuras.)*

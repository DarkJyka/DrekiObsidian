# The Ashen
The Ashen are group of mercenaries who follow the instruction of the Ashen One. Who the [[Ashen One]] truly is is unknown. They are often looked at as if they are some lesser cult. Although this may be true, they claim they are above religion. They follow the instruction of the Ashen One, usually seeking to expand their influence, using their manpower.

They are currently working for [[The Weaved]], a group thatÂ follows the cosmic instruction of [[Sharana]], the Fateweaver, a deity-like entity whose followers try and correct those who oppose the Fateweaver's Grand Design.

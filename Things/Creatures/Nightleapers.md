# Nightleapers
A black and green ringed snake, known for it's ability to leap up to 30 feet in one direction. *(Basically the normal snake monster stat block, but with the 30 foot jump as a movement option, and double poison damage.)*

- The party first heard of these snakes from [[Keira Stouthand]], as some of the townsfolk of [[Queensgrace]] have been bitten in the fields.
- They are extremely venomous.

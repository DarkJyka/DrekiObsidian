# Cosmi
The Cosmi are 4th dimensional entities that observe our world. They rarely interact or influence the Material Plane, though when a Cosmi influences, they do so in a way that would make one think of them as a god. They are ageless, and only take shape when they wish to enjoy the trivialities of Drekigard.

They are beings of immesurable power, so far so that researches of them think that our reality is but a toy, one among many for these creatures. It is unknown how many Cosmi there are, or whether or not they are hostile, but the lack of meeasures against them makes one wish they never become so.

##### Noted Cosmi include:
- [[Ar'Ced Ani]], the being behind the inspiration of [[The Dawn March]], a group of their followers.
- [[Sharana]], a being who enjoy predicting and then influencing fate. Much to the dismay of the Goddess [[Pikh]].

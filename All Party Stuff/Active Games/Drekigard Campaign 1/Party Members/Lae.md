##### Backstory
Lae Masne is an enigmatic wandering gambler hailing from the somewhat-reclused fishing village of [[Masneswell]]. Her origin is a mystery even to her, but what matters is, as a young changeling, she found herself stumbling upon this village in search of a home. Curious both about her nature as a changeling and these people and their culture, she shifted her form to match that of local children of about her age, mimicking their mannerisms and speech patterns. 
When she was first discovered to be a child-mimicking changeling, the townspeople were terrified, but they let her live upon realizing she was essentially a harmless child herself. She was essentially raised by the collective village, and while her mimicking behavior was unsettling to the adults, the children all found it quite amusing. She was granted the name Lae Masne, after the village’s name, and she had a home.
After a long period of studying some magical techniques of morally gray intent under one of her friends’ tutelage and acquiring a sacred fishing rod of her people by dubious means, she set out on a quest of self-exploration, guided only by a deep love for gold and equipped only with incredible skill at reading and manipulating other humans… and a fishing rod, of course.

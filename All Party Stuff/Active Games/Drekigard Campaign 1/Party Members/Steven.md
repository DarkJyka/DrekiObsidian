##### Backstory
Steven was born into a poor family and was given up for adoption by his lovely parents who he never met and don't want to meet him for some reason.* He was adopted by a current father, a major Cavalry leader for the Ratzal army. At a young age, Steven already did not enjoy being around horses. He assumed that he would get over that disliking when he was older. When Steven was of age, he joined the military in the same branch as his father trying to live up to his expectations. While he was in training though, he realised he was mildly afraid of the horses, and not wanting to dissapoint his father just dealt with it. Eventually, Steven had enough and left the military to try to find a career he would be happy in. One preferrably without horses.

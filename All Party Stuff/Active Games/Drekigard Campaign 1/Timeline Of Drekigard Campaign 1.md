# Drekigard Campaign One
#### Session 1 - Lost Children Go
##### 2022/04/13
>The 1st of Xerxas, the 4th year Post-Centuras. 

**5 AM**
- The party starts their journey in the ruined city of [[Queensgrace]], waking up to the sounds of panic that can be only associated with a bandit attack.
- They wake up, and successfully defend their camp, named Circle 11, from the bandits that were attacking them. *+200 XP*
- [[Kohjh]] recognizes the symbol on the bandits' armour as the mark of the once-mercenary group turned bad [[Horizon's Slash]].
- The group meets [[Quintillus Vaddner]], the Warden of the city. The party was unimpressed with his handling of the captured bandits. Being told to "Kill them," doesn't sit right with some of the party. He seems to not respect anyone who would attack another person.
- They also meet Vaddner's drake, [[Loon]]. They are a [Moon Drake](https://5e.tools/bestiary.html#moon%20drake_ccodex) and follow his commands to the letter. They also have trouble landing.
- Using interrogation and torture techniques, the party manages to find that the leader of [[Horizon's Slash]]'s name is [[Krinsen]].
- Unfortunately, the bandits beared the mark of the [[Binded Tongue]], meaning that when they disclosed the information about themselves, even their name or their boss', their heads exploded, leaving behind no way for them to betray their group.
- [[Kohjh]] sets an [alarm](https://5e.tools/spells.html#alarm_phb) spell, to wake him if someone approaches the camp.
- The group then sleeps, deciding that they will solve their troubles in the morning.

- As he awakens, he notices the bodies from last night have floated out to sea.

- [[Kohjh]] uses some of his rations to give the party breakfast.
- [[Lae|Lae]] and [[Sha'yol|Sha'yol]] catch fish to add to breakfast. They have varying degrees of success.
- As they eat, they notice carts hauling both dead townsfolk and bandits alike off to an unknown burial location.
- They talk to the elven duo, and find that they have been together for "a while", though  [[Lily Avainblood|Lily]] has known  [[Eva Anabar|Eva]] for longer.  [[Lily Avainblood|Lily]] has also not always been  [[Eva Anabar|Eva]]'s maid.
- [[Lily Avainblood|Lily]] sets up a circle of salt around [[Eva Anabar|Eva]]'s tent.
- [[Eva Anabar|Eva]] believes that this will keep her safe from demons, devils, vampires and werewolves, among other things.

**12 PM**
- [[Lae|Lae]] leads the party further into town, through the harbour to Circle 1, where the city centre and government of [[Queensgrace]] is located.
- [[Quintillus Vaddner|Vaddner]]'s tent is long, has a centre office and two bedrooms, one on each end. It's fairly large.
- The assistant, known as [[Keira Stouthand|The Keeper]] is a halfling woman named [[Keira Stouthand]]. She gives off huge camp counselor vibes.
- During a makeshift "role-call", three people gave fake names:
	- [[Eva Anabar|Eva Ruinsglade]], who seemed to make up her last name on the spot. 
	- [[Praecillius|Kravas Hransgard]], an autumnal eladrin man who seemed to give a full fake name.
	- [[Koi|Number Thirteen]], a human(?) wizard who just gave this title.
- The party hears talk in the crowd, if they were to solve the [[Horizon's Slash]] problem, there could be a community reward.
- [[Keira Stouthand]] warned the townsfolk about [[Nightleapers|black & green snakes that jump]] as people have been bitten, and the snakes are extremely venomous.
- As they pass through the Twilightknot district of the city, they see camps that were dug in to the hills. These are mostly stomped in, with large footprints.
- These footprints suggest that whatever made them was around 15 feet tall.
- They exit the city a small distance, heading to [[Quintillus Vaddner|Vaddner]]'s secret camp.
- He is torturing one of the captured Bandit Captains. The captain's name is [[Dean Thornsblade|Dean]].
- [[Dean Thornsblade|Dean]] to [[Quintillus Vaddner|Vaddner]]: "[[Keith the One-Horned Ogre|Keith]] will stomp on your corpse."
- [[Kohjh]] heals [[Dean Thornsblade|Dean]]'s hands, just so that he can draw a crude map of their camp. Which he does.
-  [[Quintillus Vaddner|Vaddner]] gives the party permission to do as they see fit, in the name of the city.
- [[Kohjh]] shows the group his old amulet when he dips it into Dean's blood, after having killed him.
- Party notices that as [[Quintillus Vaddner|Vaddner]] steps into the light, his armor reacts, lighting up with runes and then blending into the colour of his environment.

- They find a note, tucked into [[Krinsen]]'s covers:
`You have failed me.
`This will not work.
`I'm afraid I will have to cut ties.
- It's written in very fine handwriting, an academic looking script. Someone with a higher education wrote this.

- From the southern chest, they loot:
	- A tome, which makes the hands tingle when holding it.

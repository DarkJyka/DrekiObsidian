# Queensgrace
## Circles
The settlements in the ruins of old Queensgrace are aptly known as Circles. They each consist of a circle of two to ten tents, each suitable for up to two people each. Each of these Circles are responsible for defending themselves, with the weakest of Circles being the furthest into the town.

## The Peoples Of Each Circle
Below is a list of all the NPCs that can be found in each circle, or that used to be found in that circle.

### Circle 1
Circle 1 is the government circle and town center of Queensgrace, after most of the city was destroyed in the [[Century War]].
- [[Quintillus Vaddner]], M dragonborn paladin.
- [[Keira Stouthand]], F halfling mage.

### Circle 3
- [[Shen Ironlung]], M dwarf gambler.

### Circle 4


### Circle 7


### Circle 11
- Circle 11 is the original meeting place of [[The Unnamed Party]].
- [[Eva Anabar|Eva Ruinsglade]] and [[Lily Avainblood]] once stayed here. These two elves left the camp after having Eva's secret be shared with Kohjh. They claimed they were not safe and left for Ambershire.

## Livramancy
Queensgrace was where the art of livramancy was created. Magic tomes that could transport the reader physically into their story became popular centuries ago, and are now collected by grand libraries and nobles the world over.

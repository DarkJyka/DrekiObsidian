# The Destruction Of The Great Forest
### (24th Year of the Tarkian Period)

In the 24th year of the [[Tarkian Period]], the Great Forest burned. The great spirits, known to protect the forest, were nowhere to be found. Whether sealed away or destroyed, the forest fell to ashes and ruin, most of the elves who lives there were forced to flee their homes, splitting themselves between the currently wartorn countries of [[Kingdom of Exol|Exol]] and [[Kingdom of Raztal|Raztal]].

Exol was quick to offer refuge, while their kingdom might suffer from a sudden influx of residents, the ruler believed that as many lives that could be saved, should.

Raztal was not so kind. While they still accepted the refuges into their land, they refused to give them citizenship until they had completed 3 years of manditory service in the war, a clause that not even prior Raztalians were subject to.

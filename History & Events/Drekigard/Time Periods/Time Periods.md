# Time Periods
The years of Drekigard have been recorded using the period system since time started being tracked, long ago by the elves.

### [[Creationne Period]] (YEAR 0 - 2600)
This period started when the large moon of Drekigard was struck by a large monster. Many thought it to be the wrath of the gods themselves. This would be known as [[Moonfall (Creationne 0)]], where the large moon, Oratius, as struck into two, smaller moons, [[Centurion]] and [[Horne]]. This marked the birth of the new time system, with all history being lost, the races of Drekigard decided to create a new system, in accordance with the two moons, to record the new time periods. They decided that only upon the decision of all world leaders would another period commence. Those same world leaders, rising from the rubble of the [[Moonfall (Creationne 0)]], decided that at that moment, the period would be known as the [[Creationne Period]].

###  [[Tarkian Period]] (YEAR NA) {104 to 4 years ago}
This period started and ended with the [[Century War]]. The war was so destructive on all parties that they agreed afterwards that it should be known to history. And so, named after the God associaited with destruction, [[Tarkus]], it was named.
